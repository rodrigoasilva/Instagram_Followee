# See who doesn't follow you back

A Python script to find out how many people don't follow you back and who they are.

This script doesn't get your account banned as you don't need to log into your account.

This script works as follows:

*First, go to instagram.com and log in to any account you have.
*Second, go to the account you want to know and open the 'Followers' window and copy everything into it and paste it into a .txt file and save. After that, do the same with the 'Following' window.

*Now just replace the txt file name in the Python script.

It will generate 2 new files, one with people who don't follow you back, and one with people who follow you and you are following back.


##Improvements:
Some improvements are:
"*" A A.I who can distiguish between a name like "Alice Bob" and a username like "alice23bob";
*One way to automaticcaly get the same txt file which is used in the python script.
